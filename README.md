# Modal Decision Trees in Julia

Warning: this package is currently not intended for external use, but functions as a publicly available implementation for a certain research project...

## Still curious?

This package extends the potential of the official Julia [package](https://github.com/bensadeghi/DecisionTree.jl) for Decision Tree and Random Forest learning, by allowing it to deal with data with dimensional components, such as *time series* or *images*. This is achieved through the use of modal logics (e.g. [Interval Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_temporal_logic)), which has a greater expressive power, compared to the commonly used propositional logic.
